# BHOP SCRIPT FOR CS2
made in python

## _Warning_
This script contains offsets that might get changer in later updates, I will try to maintain the script as much as possible so if the script outputs an error or it doesnt work, please check [this repo](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/blob/main/output/offsets.cs) and update the offsets yourself (or wait for me to do it).

## Tutorial
1. Download _pymem_ and _pywin32_ : 
   ``` pip install pymem ```
   ``` pip install pywin32 ```
2. Download [bhop.py](https://github.com/mybRset/bhop-in-python/blob/main/bhop.py)
3. Open cs2
4. Run the script by running ``` py bhop.py ```_(you might need to direct your terminal to your folder)_
5. Now, enjoy bhopping while pressing the _spacebar_
